        "The University of Zambia publishes numerous scholarly articles across various disciplines, but there is no automated system to categorize these publications according to Zambia’s Vision 2030 sector classifications (e.g., Education, Health, Agriculture). This lack of classification makes it difficult for policymakers, researchers, and students to quickly identify research relevant to national development priorities. Manually sorting articles is time-consuming and prone to human error, limiting the accessibility and impact of academic research.\n"
